== WITHIN THIS REPOSITORY ==

The repository contains example configuration files to aid
with setup of various software pieces. The philosophy employed was
one of letting the underlying distribution simplify the overall setup.

This meant leveraging the default behavior of "Xsession", the 
"alternatives" system, and various hook or "$product.d" directories.

Finally, there is a post-checkout hook included which may be useful
in correcting "working tree" file ownership (which are throughout 
the filesystem).

== ON THE SYSTEM ==

The repository is meant to be cloned to the root of the filesystem by 
the root user. Certainly, this makes the example repository much more
distribution-specific. However, it may certainly make your life simpler.
It does ours :).

There is a somewhat complicated scattering of .gitignore files throughout
the repo which help to make changes which are important to the LG project
(e.g.  anything inside /home/lg) obvious while tending to mask changes
made which are outside the scope of the LG project (e.g. /var/)

The following tree represents the suggested directory hierarchy 
within the "lg" user's home directory:

/home/lg
|-- bin
|-- earth
|   |-- builds
|   |   |-- latest -> ./6.2.X.XXXX-X
|   |   `-- 6.2.X.XXXX-X
|   |-- config
|   |   |-- master
|   |   `-- slave
|   `-- scripts
|-- etc
`-- media
    `-- images
        |-- backgrounds
        `-- google

When using example scripts and tools within this repo, there will be
an "/lg" directory on the system owned by "lg" user.
